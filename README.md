#CHRISTMASS LIGHTS

Clone repository using command git clone https://github.com/pchessah/sample-react-app.git;

Open terminal pointed to the location where the repository is saved e.g C:\sample-react-app

Run npm install from the terminal.

Once finished run npm start to open application on your default browser on http://localhost:3000/

An online version has been deployed to : https://sample-react-app-eta.vercel.app/

NB: Currently the application is connected to my own firebase firestore for testing. Future iterations will change this with an inclusion of environments
